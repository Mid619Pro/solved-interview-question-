1.PEP(python enchancement proposal) 8 helps developers write clean, readable and maintainable code 
that is easy to share and understand within the Python community.

2.pip is the package installer for Python, main purpose is to manage Python packages.

3.set-> when u converting to 'SET' it eliminates dublicate characters in strings

4.sourcecode(.py) -> byteCode(.pyc) ->  (PVM), which executes it line-by-line

5.Private Attribute-> __name(double underscore),Protected Attribute->_name(single underscore)

6.Python is case-sensitive language

7.Pandas is an open-source tools for data analysis and manipulation.

8.FOR-LOOP:
   -> Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range)
   -> Number of iterations is known 

9.WHILE-LOOP:
    -> Repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
    -> Number of iterations is Unknown and loop should continue until
       a certain condition changes.

10. Indentation is cruical.Python Interpreter uses indentation to execute the flow of code

11.self-> used to represent instance of a class and is essential for accessing instance variables and methods.

12.GARBAGE COLLECTION:
      -> Reference Counting :
             Each time a reference is created, the count goes up.
             Each time a reference is removed, the count goes down.
             When the count reaches zero, the object is eligible for garbage collection.
      -> Cycle Detection :
             sometimes in cyclic references they not reaches Zero.In that scenario
              garbage collector detect that and remove it
  
13.Python supports Multiple inheritance

14. Techniques for memory management, including automatic memory allocation, 
    reference counting, garbage collection, and memory pools.

15.  Python manages memory using a private heap space for objects and datastructure.
     programmer cant directly access this private heap and managed by python interpreter.

16. How to delete a file using python?
     -> os.remove()
     -> os.unlink()

17. sort() and sorted() function uses Timsort algorithm

18. list[] is mutable and tuple() is immutable

19. slicing:
       my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
       slice1 = my_list[2:5] # Output: [2, 3, 4]
       slice2 = my_list[:4] # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]
       slice3 = my_list[5:] # Output: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
       slice4 = my_list[::2] # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
